	<h2 class="mrgn-tp-0">7. While on EI</h2>
	 <p class="p-content">If you work while receiving maternity or parental benefits and have served your waiting period, you will be able to keep 50 cents of your EI benefits for every dollar you earn, up to 90 percent of the weekly insurable earnings used to calculate your EI benefit amount. This 90 percent amount is called the earnings threshold. If you earn any money above this threshold, we will deduct it dollar for dollar from your benefits.</p>
	<p class="p-content">For more information, visit the <a href="/en/employment-social-development/programs/ei-list/ei/working-while-claim.html">Working While on Claim</a> page.</p>

	  <p class="p-content"> The following types of income will be deducted from your EI maternity and parental benefits:</p>
	  <ul type="disc">
	   <li class="multi-bullet">other income from employment (including    self-employment), such as commissions;</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">payments received as compensation for a work    accident or an occupational illness, such as compensation for lost wages;</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">payments received under a group health insurance    plan or a group wage loss replacement plan;</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">certain payments received under an accident    insurance plan to replace lost wages;</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">retirement income from a retirement plan, a military    or police pension, the Canada Pension Plan, the Quebec Pension Plan, or    provincial employment-based plans; and</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">allowances, amounts, or other benefits paid under    provincial legislation, such as benefits under the Quebec Parental    Insurance Program.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="p-content">Other types of income have no impact on your EI maternity and parental benefits, including:</p>
	  <ul type="disc">
	   <li class="content-bullet">disability benefits;</li>
	   <li class="content-bullet">survivor or dependent benefits;</li>
	   <li class="content-bullet">workers' compensation benefits paid under specific    regulations;</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">additional insurance benefits paid under a private    plan approved by Service Canada (for example, payments for pain and    suffering or medical expenses that you receive from an insurance company    after you have been injured in a car accident);</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">additional maternity  or parental  benefits paid by your employer    from a supplemental unemployment benefit plan (as long as the income,    benefits, and additional amounts combined do not exceed 100% of your    weekly earnings);</li>
	   <li class="multi-bullet">sickness or disability payments received under a    private wage loss replacement plan; and</li>

	 <section>
	  <h2>Protecting Employment Insurance—with your help</h2>
	  <p class="p-content">Service Canada works to protect the EI program from misuse. One of the ways we do this is by working with employers and claimants to ensure the accuracy of the information we receive. With your help, we can reduce the amount of misuse and ensure that the EI program is used as it should be—as a program that provides temporary financial assistance to individuals who qualify.</p>
	  <section>
	   <h3>What is a mistake</h3>
	   <p class="p-content">A mistake is an unintentional act. We know claimants can make mistakes when filing their reports. Common mistakes include:</p>
	   <ul type="disc">
	    <li class="multi-bullet">estimating    weekly earnings instead of putting in the actual amount earned;</li>
	    <li class="content-bullet">declaring    net earnings instead of gross earnings;</li>
	    <li class="content-bullet">forgetting    to declare all the earnings received;</li>
	    <li class="content-bullet">writing or    entering the wrong number when reporting earnings; or</li>
	    <li class="content-bullet">adding the    number of hours or amount of earnings incorrectly.</li>
	   </ul>
	   <p class="p-content">Some mistakes can delay benefit payments, while others can affect the amount of benefits you receive—meaning you are paid more or less than you are entitled to receive.</p>
	   <p class="p-content"> For example, estimating your earnings can have the following effects:</p>
	   <ul type="disc">
	    <li class="multi-bullet">If you    estimated your earnings for one week and your estimate was higher than the    earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be less than it    should have been. If this happens, let us know and we will adjust your    file to make sure you receive all the benefits to which you are entitled.</li>
	    <li class="multi-bullet">If you    estimated your earnings for one week and your estimate was lower than the    earnings you actually received, your benefit amount will be higher than it    should have been. Let us know if this happens. You will have to repay the    excess amount, but we will ensure that repaying it causes no undue    hardship. As well, we will adjust your file to reflect your accurate    information.</li>
	   </ul>
	   <p class="p-content">
	    <strong>If you notice a mistake</strong> on a completed form or report, or if there is a change in your circumstances that could affect your EI claim, tell <strong>Service Canada immediately</strong>. This will help prevent any future problems with your claim.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	   <h3>Absence from Canada</h3>
	   <p class="p-content">Although you can receive EI maternity and parental benefits while you are outside Canada, you usually <strong>cannot</strong> be outside Canada while you are receiving other types of EI benefits.</p>
	   <p class="p-content"> One measure we take to enforce this rule is to compare EI information with information from the Canada Border Services Agency. If we find you have been out of the country while collecting benefits, we will determine whether you were entitled to receive those benefits. If you were not entitled to receive them, we will calculate how much we overpaid you, and you will then have to repay the benefits.</p>
	   <p class="p-content"> We may also impose penalties of up to three times your weekly benefit rate or three times the amount of your overpayment. As well, you may have to work more hours or, in the case of self-employment in fishing, you may need more insurable earnings to qualify for benefits in the future.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	   <h3>Misrepresentation</h3>
	   <p class="p-content">If you knowingly withhold information, make misleading statements, or misrepresent the facts to make a false claim for benefits, this is considered misrepresentation. You could face severe monetary penalties or prosecution. This could also affect your future benefits. However, if you disclose your actions to Service Canada before an investigation begins, we may waive any monetary penalties and prosecutions that might otherwise apply.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	   <h3>Consequences of misrepresentation: Interest and penalties</h3>
	   <p class="p-content">
	    <strong>Interest on debt</strong>
	   </p>
	   <p class="p-content"> When EI claimants receive benefits to which they are not entitled, the amount of the overpayment counts as a debt that must be repaid.</p>
	   <p class="p-content"> Service Canada charges interest on this debt when it results from claimants who knowingly omit information or make false or misleading representations or statements. However, we do not charge interest on debt that results when Service Canada makes an error in the benefit payment.</p>
	   <p class="p-content"> The rate of interest is the Bank of Canada average rate plus 3%. Interest is calculated daily and compounded monthly.</p>
	   <p class="p-content">
	    <strong>Penalties</strong>
	   </p>
	   <p class="p-content"> A penalty may be imposed on a claimant, an employer, or an individual acting on their behalf in relation to a claim for benefits when he or she has:</p>
	   <ul type="disc">
	    <li class="content-bullet">knowingly    made false or misleading representations or statements; or</li>
	    <li class="content-bullet">completed a    statement without declaring essential information.</li>
	   </ul>
	   <p class="p-content">There are many situations when a penalty may apply, and the amount could become very high. Depending on the circumstances, the maximum penalty could be up to three times the amount of the overpayment, three times the weekly benefit rate for each incident of misrepresentation, or three times the maximum benefit rate.</p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	   <h3>False or misleading statements </h3>
	   <p class="p-content">If you knowingly withhold information or make a false or misleading statement, you have committed an act or omission that could result in an overpayment of benefits as well as severe penalties or prosecution. However, if you notify Service Canada of your actions, we can waive monetary penalties or prosecution if we are not already investigating the matter. </p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	   <h3>Money owing</h3>
	   <p class="p-content">If you owe any money to the Employment Insurance program, or the Canada Revenue Agency, or if the Department of Justice is garnisheeing your wages for unpaid family support, we may have to deduct money directly from your benefits. To make repayment arrangements, call the number indicated on your overpayment notice. </p>
	   <section>
	    <h4>Violations</h4>
	    <p class="p-content">Deliberate misuse of the EI program can result in a violation. With a violation, claimants may need more insurable earnings or hours to qualify for benefits in the future. The required amount rises based on the number and seriousness of misrepresentations that have been recorded in the five-year period before the start of their claims. </p>

	 <section>
