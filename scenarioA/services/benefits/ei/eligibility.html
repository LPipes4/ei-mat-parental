<h2 class="mrgn-tp-0">2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p class="p-content">The following information is a  guideline. We encourage you to apply for benefits so our processing agents can  determine if you are eligible.</p>
    <p class="p-content"> You may be eligible to receive Employment Insurance (EI)  maternity or parental benefits if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="content-bullet">you are employed in insurable employment;</li>
      <li class="content-bullet">you meet the specific criteria for receiving EI maternity or parental benefits;</li>
      <li class="content-bullet">your normal weekly earnings are reduced by more than 40%; and</li>
      <li class="multi-bullet">you have accumulated at least 600 hours of insurable employment during the qualifying period <strong>or</strong>, if you are a self-employed fisher, you have earned enough money during the qualifying period.</li>
    </ul>
    <section>
      <h3>You are employed in insurable  employment</h3>
      <p class="p-content">If you are employed in insurable employment, your  employer will deduct the applicable EI premiums from your wages or salary. </p>
      <p class="p-content">You need to pay EI premiums on all your earnings up to a maximum amount. In 2018, for every $100 you earn, your employer will deduct $1.66, until your annual earnings reach the maximum yearly insurable amount of $51,700. The maximum amount of premiums to be paid in 2018 is therefore $858.22.</p>
      <p class="p-content">Since Quebec has its own program that offers maternity, paternity, and parental benefits, the Government of Canada has adjusted the premiums accordingly for that province. In 2018, the premium rate for workers in Quebec is set at $1.30 for every $100 of earnings, up to a maximum amount of $672.10 for the year.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>You meet the specific criteria  for receiving EI maternity or parental benefits</h3>
      <p class="p-content">
        <strong>EI maternity benefits</strong> are payable only to the  biological mother who is unable to work because she is pregnant or has recently  given birth. To receive maternity benefits, you need to prove your pregnancy by  signing a statement declaring the expected due date or the actual date of  birth.</p>
      <p class="p-content"><strong>EI parental benefits</strong> are payable only to the biological, adoptive, or  legally recognized parents while they are caring for their newborn or newly  adopted child or children. To receive parental benefits, you must sign a  statement declaring the newborn’s date of birth or, when there is an adoption,  the child’s date of placement for the purposes of the adoption and the name and  address of the adoption authority. In cases where the child is not legally  adoptable, parental benefits could be payable from the date you attest that you  consider the placement a permanent one. In these circumstances, the Commission  may, at any time, request proof certifying that the child for whom you are  claiming parental benefits has been placed with you by a recognized authority  and that the placement was not merely a temporary one.</p>
      <p class="p-content"> For <strong>biological  or legally recognized parents</strong>, EI parental benefits can be paid starting  from the child's date of birth. For <strong>adoptive parents</strong>, parental benefits  can be paid starting from the date the child is placed with them for the  purpose of adoption. In cases where the child is not legally adoptable,  parental benefits could be payable from the date you attest that you consider  the placement a permanent one.    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Your normal weekly earnings are  reduced by more than 40%</h3>
      <p class="p-content">When your normal weekly earnings are reduced by more than 40% because of  pregnancy or your need to care for newborn or newly adopted children, you may  be eligible for EI maternity or parental benefits.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>You have accumulated at least  600 hours of insurable employment during the qualifying period</h3>
      <p class="p-content">
        <strong>Hours of insurable employment</strong> are the hours you work, for  either one or more employers under written or verbal contracts of service, for  which you receive wages.</p>
      <p class="p-content"> The <strong>qualifying period</strong> is the shorter of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="multi-bullet">the 52-week period immediately before the start date       of your EI period; <strong>or</strong>
        </li>
        <li class="multi-bullet">the period since the start of a previous EI benefit       period, if that benefit period started during the last 52 weeks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="p-content">To be eligible for <strong>EI maternity benefits</strong>, you must have  accumulated at least 600 hours of insurable employment in your qualifying  period. If you are a <strong>self-employed fisher</strong>, you must have earned $3,760  from fishing during the 31-week qualifying period immediately before the start  of your benefit period.</p>
      <p class="p-content"> To be eligible for <strong>EI parental benefits</strong>, each parent who applies  for benefits must have accumulated at least 600 hours of insurable employment  in his or her qualifying period. If you are a <strong>self-employed fisher</strong>, you  must have earned $3,760 from fishing during the 31-week qualifying period  immediately before the start of your benefit period.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Both parents apply for EI  parental benefits</h3>
      <p class="p-content">Both parents can apply for EI parental benefits but they have to share  the benefits. Furthermore, both parents are required to choose the same  parental benefit option, either standard or extended. The option chosen by the  first claimant who completes the EI application will be considered as the  option chosen by the second claimant. The choice is final once parental  benefits have been paid on a claim. This means that you cannot change between  standard and extended once parental benefits have been paid.</p>
      <section>
      <h4>Standard parental benefits:</h4>
      <p class="p-content">In total, there are 35 weeks of standard parental  benefits available to eligible parents of a newborn or newly adopted child.</p>
      <p class="p-content">There are many ways you can decide to use your standard  parental benefits. For instance, one of the parents can take the entire 35  weeks of standard parental benefits, or both parents can share them.</p>
      <section>
        <h5>Examples</h5>
      <ul>
        <li class="multi-bullet">If the  biological mother wants to return to work after her maternity leave, the other  parent can then take the 35 weeks of standard parental benefits.</li>
        <li class="multi-bullet">If one parent  decides to take only 10 weeks of standard parental benefits before returning to  work, the other parent can use the remaining 25 weeks of standard parental benefits.</li>
        <li class="multi-bullet">If one parent  decides to return to work after taking a few weeks of standard parental benefits,  but then realizes a few weeks later that he or she would prefer to stay home  with the child, he or she is still entitled to the unused weeks of standard parental  benefits, as long as the 52-week period after the birth or adoption placement  has not expired.</li>
      </ul>
	  </section>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h4>Extended parental benefits:</h4>
      <p class="p-content"> In  total, there are 61 weeks of extended parental benefits available to eligible  parents of a newborn or newly adopted child.</p>
      <p class="p-content">There are many  ways you can decide to use your extended parental benefits. For instance, one of  the parents can take the entire 61 weeks of extended parental benefits, or both  parents can share them.</p>
      <section>
        <h5>Examples</h5>
      <ul>
        <li class="multi-bullet">If the  biological mother wants to return to work after her maternity leave, the other  parent can then take the 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.</li>
        <li class="multi-bullet">If one parent  decides to take only 20 weeks of extended parental benefits before returning to  work, the other parent can use the remaining 41 weeks of extended parental  benefits.</li>
        <li class="multi-bullet">If one parent  decides to return to work after taking a few weeks of extended parental benefits,  but then realizes a few weeks later that he or she would prefer to stay home  with the child, he or she is still entitled to the unused weeks of extended parental  benefits, as long as the 78-week period after the birth or adoption placement  has not expired.</li>
